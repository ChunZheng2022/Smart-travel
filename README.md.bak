where fspconv80.pth is the weight of Focal3DDet, best.pt is the best yolov5 weight and BiseNetv2 is a segmentation weight.

You can download the data set here. We rename image_02 with image_2 as the input image and rename velodyne_points with velodyne.
You need to organize the data like this:
-data
    -testing
        -image_2
        -velodyne

You can also use your own data by organize data in the above format.

Considering that this is a conpetition software, the code is only upload to official competition website. Maybe we will upload it later.
